To run code:
1. Open command line/terminal
2. Execute "python comp499_as1.py"

To show different images:
1. Open comp499_as1.py in a text/code editor
2. Change the variable "imageName" on line 10 to either 'oldwell', 'crayons', or 'pencils'*
* Entering an image name that is not in the image_set folder will cause an error

Other:
- All text answers (e.g. for part 1) are written as comments in the code
- All image windows must be closed before running the code again
- The outputs for parts 1 and 2 are shown at the same time. To show only one part at a time, comment out the two lines below the "Part 1/2 specific outputs" comments
- Artifact comparisons between parts 1 and 2 are in the "Artifacts" folder
